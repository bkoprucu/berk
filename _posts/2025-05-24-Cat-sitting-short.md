## Dangers

### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting on them without checking may hurt:

### Stove

They jump on it and may accidentally turn it on, potentially burn their paws.

Pan handle should be blocking the switch:

### Dish sponge

Kücük chews the dish sponge! That's why I keep it in the sink.

## Daily Routine

Feel free to enter the apartment with your shoes on. Cat's will make a mess anyway. I'll do a deep cleaning when I'm back.

### Litter Box

For two days, just throwing the poop to the toilet bowl and stirring the litter should be enough.

Wooden pallets stuck on the poop dissolve into dust, won't clog the toilet.

The litter in the box should be shallow, only couple centimeters deep.

**Cleaning the litter box:**

I pour thin layer of clumping litter as a substrate to the bottom tray to prevent smell.<br>
Every other day, you may remove the clumped pieces in the bottom tray using their shovel.<br>
You may put them in one of the paper bags in the bathroom, which you can throw away in the silo on your way out. **Clumping litter shouldn't go into the toilet.** 

### Feeding

**Here's what I do to prevent Pamuk from eating Kucuk's food.** 

One pouch for both of them, since Kucuk doens't eat much wet food:

You may use a new set of small flat plates each time. 

Pamuk eats more wet food, so I share the pouch ~70% to Pamuk, ~30% to Kucuk:

I've put dust of Pamuk's asthma medicine pills in small glasses, shown in the picture below. Once a day, usually on evenings, you may pour one glass on his food.

I'm putting a piece of newspaper under their plate to contain the spill. You may replace them after each feeding.

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk_plate.webp" width="450px" description="Kucuk's plate. It is important to close the door and leave her alone" -%}


**To allow Kucuk to eat: First Pamuk's plate under the kitchen table, while he is eating, Kücük's plate under the chair in the bedroom.** 

**I close the bedroom door right away and leave Kucuk alone for 5 minutes.**  

After 5 minutes, you may open bedroom door to let Pamuk eat Kucuk's leftovers.

To avoid washing dishes, I either rinse them and put in the dishwasher, or stack them in the sink and make them soak them with this diluted soap:

After they're done with the wet food, I give them dry food. I find it easier to feed them from these boxes, using the spoon:

Kucuk doesn't eat as much wet food, therefore I give her more dry food:

### Water

Two white Ikea water bowls, one in the main room, beneath the chair, other in the bedroom. <br>

They're picky about their water. I let the tap run until its cold, before rinsing / refilling their bowls.    

<br>

**You may leave the apartment without waiting for them to finish their dry food.**

**Before leaving, it is a good idea to check the bathroom door is not closed**

I'll be happy if you can keep me updated after each visit.
