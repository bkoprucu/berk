Here is quick info for how to take care of Pamuk and Kucuk:


### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes eating, going out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy, never gets aggressive. Likes dry food, affection, getting brushed.

## Dangers

### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting on them without checking can hurt:

### Being Locked Outside

You may leave the window open after feeding in the evening. To prevent window getting closed:

Place the half ball on the corner:

![window](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/window.webp)

Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

You may push the kitchen door, leave a small gep, so they can open it, and you can retain the heat inside.

## Feeding

**Follow these instructions to prevent Pamuk from eating Kucuk's food:** 

- In the morning, make sure that they are both inside and close the window.

- Take one pouch from this box:

For wet food, You may use flat plates.

Pamuk may spill some food, a piece of napkins under the plate can help.

Pamuk eats more wet food, sometimes I give ~70% of the pouch to Pamuk, and ~30% to Kucuk:

After they're done with the wet food, I give Kucuk more kibble than Pamuk:

Pamuk eats Kucuk's food. To prevent this you need to separate them:

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table first.
- While he is eating, put Kucuk's food in the bedroom, under the chair.
- Close the bedroom or kitchen door to separate them and leave Kucuk alone. She may not eat while you're in there.
- Pamuk will wait at her door, demanding you to open the door. Allow Kucuk to at least 5 minutes in piece, after which you may open the door.
- If Kucuk didn't finish her wet food, you may move her plate to the Kitchen and give it to Pamuk.
- Now you can give them dry food, give less to Pamuk since he has probably eaten more wet food already. As usual, keep them in separate rooms. 
- After some time they'll meow, you may open the doors and take away any food Kucuk may have left. We don't want Pamuk to overeat.
- After feeding in the evening, [you may open the window](#being-locked-outside)
- At night, you may give them a little bit of dry food, so that they won't wake you up early in the morning.


**Rinse and change their water once a day. I do it at night, before sleeping**

## Pamuk's medicine

You may give Pamuk his pill 3 times until I'm back. I'll remind you to give them. I crushed the pills and made a dust, and put them in little glasses, as in the picture below. You can pour it on his wet food.

## Brushing

I've stopped flea drops because of health issues they've caused. Brushing them regularly keeps the flea away.

They may demand it. 

Please brush them daily, after removing their collar.

**I'll be happy if you can keep me updated**

## **Thank you! :)**
