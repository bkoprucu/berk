Here is quick info for how to take care of Pamuk and Kucuk:


### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes eating, going out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy, never gets aggressive. Likes dry food, affection, getting brushed.

## Dangers

### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting on them without checking can hurt:

### Being Locked Outside

You may leave the window open after feeding in the evening. To prevent window getting closed:

Place the half ball on the corner:

Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

## Feeding

- In the morning, make sure that they are both inside and close the window.

- Take one pouch from this box:

For wet food, You may use a flat plate.

Pamuk may spill some food, a piece of napkins under the plate can help.

Pamuk eats more wet food, sometimes I give ~70% of the pouch to Pamuk, and ~30% to Kucuk:

To compensate, I give Kucuk more dry food:

Pamuk eats Kucuk's food. To prevent this you need to separate them:

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table first.
- While he is eating, put Kucuk's food in bedroom, under the chair.
- Close the door and leave her alone. You may instead close the kitchen door, leaving Pamuk inside the kitchen.
- Pamuk will wait at her door, demanding opening the door. Allow Kucuk to at least 5 minutes in piece, after which you may open the door.
- Now you can give them dry food, again in separate rooms.

- After feeding in the evening, [you may open the window](#being-locked-outside)


**Rinse and change their water once a day**

## Pamuk's medicine

You may give Pamuk his pill on Sunday. I crushed the pills and made dust, and put them in a little glass, as shown in the picture below. You can pour it on his wet food.
