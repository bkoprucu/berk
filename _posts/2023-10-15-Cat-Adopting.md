After years of living with cats, rescuing them, and learning about them, I'll shortly summarize what I know about cat care, and living with them in a harmony.

## First Needs

I tried to list what cats need upon arrival, ordered in priority.

### Calm 'Base'

Cats are psychologically sensitive animals. They can get overwhelmed and depressed easily. Changes in their environment, noise, any changes in their routine puts them under great stress.

They need a safe / quiet place where they won't be bothered. This is both important on first days and during the lifetime of the cat.

They may hide under the bed or behind the couch for that reason.

This may be a cardboard box laying on side, and a cloth or pillow underneath. Top should be covered to help them feel safe.

### Other People, Petting

It is best to not to disturb the cat for the first day, esp. for first couple hours. They may be quite scared and confused. Leaving them in their previously arranged ['Base'](#calm-base) is a good idea. Guests, to much noise, many people showing attention is for them stressful. 

Later on, petting should be done by first allowing the cat to smell your hand, by slowly approaching from the chin, basically surrendering yourself, letting the cat decide whether they want to be petted or not.

Cats like stroked around their head, usually not their belly or tail. After they grow up, you may stroke their belly as well, but some cats may never like it.

Petting may get overstimulating to a cat, and purring may follow a sudden slap, bite or scratching. In cats world, this is usually not aggressive, but just communicating that it is enough. I recommend petting little bit less than what they want, and adjusting it over time. When the trust has been built over years, you can do whatever you want and communication becomes meowing, rather than biting.

### Toilet

Initially ['base'](#calm-base) should be not far from litter box, especially for kittens. You may put the cat on the litter box and leave him so he'll go back to his base, knowing where the litter box is. Kittens may need a stair (build with a book) to climb to the box.

Shortly after you may want to put the box away from eating place, maybe in the bathroom.

#### Litter Box Material

Silica crystal and parfumed litter is not healthy for cat or you. You wouldn't want to breathe its dust. 
For kittens I'd recommend "natural" litter for the first couple months.

Switching to wood pellets and mesh box, is cleaner and requires much less work. 

I use [PeeWee:](https://peewee.se)

#### Teaching to Use Toliet Bowl

I have successfully taught my cat to use the toilet bowl in the past. But I was ignorant of the problems it introduces:

- It may be a safety hazard, they may fall, lid may close on them
- Not natural for the cats, making urinating a stressful thing
- Their litter box, and its smell marks their territory. They'll feel stressed without that
- It'll be more dangerous for the cat, when they age
- You'll have to keep the lid open

### Food and Water

#### Food
- Dry food (kibble) is suspected to cause cancer and urinal traction in long term. It is however practical and trains their jaw, and teeth. I'll recommend giving them less and good quality one.
- Wet food is much preferable.
- Clean bowl is important. Bowl is not needed for wet food. I use regular (small) and flat plates, which I put in the dishwasher afterwards.
- Feeding should be in the same place, 2-3 times a day for adult cats, much more for kittens, this depending on their age.
- Feeding place should be away from their litter box, not in bathroom.

#### Water
Cats tend to drink not enough and develop kidney and urinal problems over the years. 
I recommend:
- Glass drinking bowl, which won't cause a smell.
- Replacing the water every day.
- Having more than one bowl in multiple places.


### Scratching Post, Cat Tree
Important need for a cat. Having this ready before cats arrival will also save you [furniture damage](#furniture-damage).

Many scratching posts in the market is too small for cats to stretch their body and get a satisfying scratching.

I use this one, which can be fixed on the side of a wardrobe:

</a>

You can make a climbing surface by fixing couple of them, which can be a good training and playing place as well.


### Second Cat

Known fact: Adopting  second cat makes everything easier. I was surprised when I first experienced this.

Two cats will:
- Play with each other, release their energy, not annoy you much.
- Will teach each other that biting and scratching hurts.
- Will be happier overall and do funny things together for you to watch.

## Entertaining

### Playing
Unless you have a second cat, regular playing with a cat is a necessity. Most effective toy to play with is probably a "cat wand":

I also play 'wrestling' after I wear on an old sock like a glove.

### Box

My cats have two boxes, one shoe box, one bigger cardbox. Cats get happy inside boxes.

### Observing
Something like this, or a cat tree by the window keeps them entertained:

Or a cat tree, like mine:

**Climbing on a tree is great training for them**

Cat entertainment videos on Youtube may work too:

### Letting Out

#### Preventing Loss
I let my cats out regularly, they have been lost twice in 6 years.

They tend to go inside strange places, where they get trapped. Solution is to use a tracking device, fixed on their collar. I am using a radio device, instead of GPS. It has a low range but is small and works indoors. I have mediocre results with Airtags.

#### Preventing Hunting

They kill mouse and small birds. Which not only is sad for those animals, also a health risk. Salmonella from sparrows, for instance, may spread both to your cat and you.

Solution is having a bell on their collar:

## Care
### Brushing
Daily brushing is necessary for their health. Long heired cats need it more. I get the best results with non-rounded wire type.

### Claw Trimming

Claw trimming doesn't always prevent the cat from scratching furniture. Excess length will be problematic, therefore, I trim them monthly.

It is important to not to cut too deep:

Here is a good guide: [https://cat-world.com/trim-cats-claws-including-photos/](https://cat-world.com/trim-cats-claws-including-photos/)

### Hair Trimming

- I'd advise to not to bring a cat to a coiffour or get cats hair trimmed.
- Long haired cats need "sanitary trim".

## Preventing Unwanted Behavior

Punishment, including spraying water doesn't work with cats. They tend to associate the punishment with you, rather than their behavior.

Consistent behavior by owners side is important.  

### Furniture Damage

Best way to reduce damage is having scratching posts around home, before the cats arrival.

After cat has developed a habit of scratching a furniture, you may try fixing two sided tape on the furniture, applying watered down lemon on two sided tape etc. I don't have first hand experience with this.

I choose to see the damage they cause  as their trace, memory. For me, they'll have a sentimental value, after my cats pass away.

### Biting and Scracthing

If you have more than one cat, they'll teach each other that is hurts. 
If you have one, you may "bite" their ears with your finger nails a bit. This shouldn't be too hard but enough to mimic how it'd feel it another were to bite them.
for kittens it may take a year to learn not to bite or scratch.

I plan to write about following topics:
- Other unwanted behaviors
- Medication, vet. visits
- Other resources
