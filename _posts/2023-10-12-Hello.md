After years of working as a software engineer, I've set up my website.
I plan to share my thoughts and knowledge about:

- Programming tips for Java and Kotlin
- The latest in Java/Kotlin and the JVM ecosystem
- Micro services architecture and frameworks (Spring Boot, Micronaut)
- Modern working methods and processes
- Cloud computing and distributed systems design 
- Common software development errors / pitfalls
- Improving performance, security, scalability, manageability of systems
- Opinions about technogoy trends and future predictions


Stay tuned :)
