### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes to eat, and go out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy but talkative. Never gets aggressive. Likes eating kibble, affection, getting brushed.

## Dangers 

### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting or laying on them without checking can be fatal.

### Stove

They jump on it and may accidentally turn it on, or burn their paws.

Place the pan handle in a way that it blocks the switch:

### Being locked outside

Don't close the kitchen window when they're outside.

If you're leaving home, if they're outside, make sure to leave the window open as shown at [Letting Out](#letting-out) section.

If they're home, close the windows.

### Kitchen sponge

Küçük chews it. After use, leave it in the small sink.

## Letting them out

If you let them out, they'll show up after some time by the window. Keep the kitchen window open, they will come back.

Place the half ball on the corner:

![window](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/window.webp)


Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

You can close the kitchen door, but leave a small gap so they can push it open when they return.

You may let them out (open the kitchen window as instructed above, and making sure they have their collars on) before going to sleep.


## Feeding

**Follow these instructions to prevent Pamuk from eating Küçük's food:**

- In the morning, make sure that they are both inside and close the window.

- Take one pouch from this box in the morning and evening:

For wet food, You may use a flat plate instead of their bowl, which you may put in the dishwasher after use:

![](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/food_dishes.jpg)

Pamuk may spill some food, a piece of napkins under the plate can help.

Give ~70% of the pouch to Pamuk, and ~30% to Küçük:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/wet_food_distribution.jpg" description="Wet food distribution. Pamuk eats ~70%, Kucuk ~30%" -%}

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table.
- While he is eating, put Kucuk's food in bedroom, under the chair.
- Close the bedroom or kitchen door to separate them, and leave Kucuk alone.  
- Pamuk will wait at her door, demanding you to open it. Allow Kucuk to eat at least 5 minutes in piece. 
- Open the door and move Kucuk's plate to the kitchen for Pamuk to eat her leftovers.
- Give them kibble in separate rooms. Less for Pamuk:
  {%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/dry_food_distribution.jpg" description="Kibble distribution: ~10% for Pamuk, ~90% for Kucuk" -%}

- After that you may take away whatever is left, and put in the cabinet. We don't want Pamuk to overeat Kucuk's leftover kibble.
- After feeding, [you may open the window](#being-locked-outside)

At night, you may give them bit of kibble, so they won't wake you up early in the morning.

Kucuk may demand more food during the day. You may give her a little. If Pamuk is inside, you'll have to give him too, but much less. 


**Rinse and change their water once a day. I do this before going to sleep.**

[//]: # (Food in the pouch box will be over after three days. You can continue with the food in small boxes:)

[//]: # (Share one box between two cats for morning, one for evening. So you'll consume two boxes per day.)


## Pamuk's medicine

I crushed Pamuks' pills and put their dust in little glasses, as shown in the picture below:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk_medicine_glasses.jpg" description="Each glass contains medicine for two days" -%}

Once in three days, I'll remind you to pour one glass on his wet food.

## Litter box
- There should not be more than 3 centimeters litter in the box.
- There is a bottom tray and meshed container on top, which lets the pee flow to the bottom tray.
- For couple days no cleaning is usually needed. You may take the turd from top with the shovel and stir the litter a bit.
- To clean, take the whole thing to bathroom, shovel off the stuff in the bottom tray to the toilet bowl, and add maybe one or two fistful of litter.


## Brushing

Flea drops have been bad for their health. Instead, I'm brushing them daily, especially Pamuk, who goes out often.

The brush is by the TV.

They, especially Kucuk, will demand it, but Pamuk needs it more.

Use the top buttons on the remote to turn on / off the reading light in main room.

All the other lights have three stages brightness. Turn off - on to switch between brightness levels.


### Dishwasher soap

Dishwasher soap is in the cabinet, on the left side of vacuum.<br>
- The package doesn't melt in the dishwasher, you'll have to open it.
- Soap box emits toxic gas. so keep the box in its cabinet.
