Here is quick info for how to take care of Pamuk and Kucuk:


### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes eating, going out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy, never gets aggressive. Likes dry food, affection, brushing.

## Dangers
 
### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting or laying on them without checking can be fatal.

### Stove

They jump on it and may accidentally turn it on or burn their paws.

Place the pan handle so that it block the turn on switch:

### Being Locked Outside

Don't close the windows when they're outside.

If you're leaving home, if they're outside, make sure to leave the window open as informed in [Letting Out](#letting-out) section.


If they're home, close the windows.

## Letting Out

If you let them out, they'll show up after some time by the window. Keep the kitchen window open, they will come back.

Place the half ball on the corner:

Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

To stop  cold, you may push the kitchen door, so they can push it open when they come back.

You may let them out before going to sleep.

## Feeding

- Take one pouch from this box for each cat in the morning:

For wet food, You may use flat plate instead of their bowl, to avoid cleaning.
However, Pamuk will spill some food to the floor, put napkins under the plate.

Kucuk is shy, and Pamuk eats his food. To prevent this:

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table first.
- While he is eating put Kucuk's food in bedroom, under the chair close the door and leave her alone.
- Pamuk will wait at her door, leave her 5 minutes to eat, then open the door.
- After 10 minutes or so, they'll want dry food, esp. Kucuk. Give them some.

Food in the pouch box will be over after three days. You can continue with the food in small boxes:

Share one box between two cats for morning, one for evening. So you'll consume two boxes per day.

**Don't forget to rinse and change their water**

## Litter Box
- There should not be much litter in the box, it should be around 3 centimeters deep
- There is a bottom tray and meshed container on top, which lets the pee to flow to bottom tray
- For couple days no cleaning is usually needed. You may take the turd from top with the shovel and stir the litter a bit
- To clean, take the whole thing to bathroom, take away the top part and shovel off the stuff in the bottom tray to toilet bowl
- You may add one or two fistful of litter after a week
