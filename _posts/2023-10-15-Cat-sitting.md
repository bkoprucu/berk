### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes to eat, and go out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy but talkative. Never gets aggressive. Likes eating kibble, affection, getting brushed.

## Dangers 

### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting or laying on them without checking can be fatal.

### Stove

They jump on it and may accidentally turn it on, or burn their paws.

Place the pan handle in a way that it blocks the switch:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/stove.webp" description="Handle blocking the switch" height="350px" -%}

Stove will be hot for a while after cooking. **Never leave the hot stove uncovered.**

Put a lid or another pot to cover it while moving away a hot pan.


### Being locked outside

Don't close the kitchen window when they're outside.

If you're leaving home, if they're outside, make sure to leave the window open as shown at [Letting Out](#letting-them-out) section.

If they're home, close the windows.

### Kitchen sponge

Küçük chews it. After use, leave it in the small sink.

## Letting them out

If you let them out, they'll show up after some time by the window. Keep the kitchen window open, they will come back.

Place the half ball on the corner:

![window](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/window.webp)


Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

You can close the kitchen door, but leave a small gap so they can push it open when they return.

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/door.jpeg" height="400px" description="The gap allows them to open the door" -%}


You may let them out (open the kitchen window as instructed above, and making sure they have their collars on) before going to sleep.


## Feeding

**Follow these instructions to prevent Pamuk from eating Küçük's food:**

- In the morning, make sure that they are both inside and close the window.

- Take one pouch from this box in the morning and evening:

![](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/food_pouch.jpeg)


For wet food, use a clean flat plate for each use:

![](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/food_dishes.jpg)

Pamuk may spill some food, a piece of napkins under the plate can help.

Give ~70% of the pouch to Pamuk, and ~30% to Küçük:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/wet_food_distribution.jpg" description="Wet food distribution. Pamuk eats ~70%, Kucuk ~30%" -%}

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table.
- While he is eating, put Kucuk's food in bedroom, under the chair.
- Close the bedroom or kitchen door to separate them, and leave Kucuk alone.  
- Pamuk will wait at her door, demanding you to open it. Allow Kucuk to eat at least 5 minutes in piece. 
- Open the door and move Kucuk's plate to the kitchen for Pamuk to eat her leftovers.
- Give them kibble in separate rooms. Less for Pamuk:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/dry_food_distribution.webp" description="Dry food distribution: ~70% for Kücük, ~30% for Pamuk" -%}

- After that you may take away whatever is left, and put in the cabinet. We don't want Pamuk to overeat Kucuk's leftover kibble.
- After feeding, [you may open the window](#being-locked-outside)

At night, you may give them bit of kibble, so they won't wake you up early in the morning.

Kucuk demands more food during the day. You may give her some kibble. If Pamuk is inside, you'll have to give him too, but much less. 

Note there are different kinds of kibble in each box:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kibble_boxes.webp" description="Different kind of kibble in each box" height="360px" -%}

**Rinse and change their water once a day. I do this before going to sleep.**

[//]: # (Food in the pouch box will be over after three days. You can continue with the food in small boxes:)

[//]: # (Share one box between two cats for morning, one for evening. So you'll consume two boxes per day.)


## Pamuk's medicine

I crushed Pamuk's pills and put their dust in little glasses, as shown in the picture below:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk_medicine_glasses.webp" description="Each glass contains medicine for two days" -%}

Every other day, pour one glass on his wet food.

## Litter box
- There should not be more than 3 centimeters pellet litter in the box.
- There is a bottom tray and meshed container on top, which lets the pee flow to the bottom tray.
- Some natural clamping litter (not pellet) in the bottom tray prevents the smell. A bit of baking soda on top of it can be useful too.
- For couple days no cleaning is usually needed. You may take the turd from top with the shovel and stir the litter a bit.
- After couple days, you may remove the clamped litter from the bottom tray. 
- To clean, take the whole thing to bathroom, shovel off the stuff in the bottom tray to the toilet bowl, and add maybe one or two fistful of litter.


## Brushing

Flea drops have been bad for their health. Instead, I'm brushing them daily, especially Pamuk, who goes out often.

The brush is by the TV.

Especially Kucuk, demands brushing, but Pamuk needs it more. 


## Much Meowing?

Esp. Kucuk can be demanding. The reasons might be:

- Kucuk eats in small portions and wants to snack some kibble. There are two kinds of kibble in each box, she might want a different kind this time.
- Boredom. Kucuk enjoys brushing, petting and chasing the laser pointer (black device by TV). You may also put the cardbox on the ottoman and put her inside. Pamuk usually just wants to go out. You may open the bedroom window for both of them to observe.
- Litter box is either dirty, or bathroom door is closed.
- Kucuk couldn't get under duvet, where she sleeps.

## Apartment

### Wifi
BR_5 / XXXXX (Ask me)

### Laundry room
Rule: You have to take the room in one hour after booking time, otherwise the booking will be dropped.

Use following address to book it:
[https://brfhs.asuscomm.com/](https://brfhs.asuscomm.com/)

Username: 01551050<br>
Password: XXXX (ask me)<br>

You can book T26A or T32A.

You can use the Ikea bags in the wardrobe, I use them to carry clean laundry. For dirty, I use the gray box in the bathroom.

### Lights

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/lights_remote.webp" description="Top two buttons switches lights in the main room" height="360px" -%}

- Top two buttons on the remote switches the stand lights in the main room. 

- Turning ceiling lights on and off swiftly changes their brightness level in three steps.

Kitchen counter light switch is right above the soap dispenser: 

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kitchen_light.webp" description="Light switch is right above the soap dispenser" height="360px" -%}

### Dishwasher soap

Dishwasher soap is in the cabinet, on the left side of vacuum.<br>
- The package doesn't melt in the dishwasher, you'll have to open it.
- Soap box emits toxic gas, therefore it has to be kept in its cabinet, away from food.

### Garbage
{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/garbage.webp" description="Shopping bags on the right" height="350px" -%}

Garbage bins for metal (top left), glass and plastics (top right), mixed (bottom left) and organic waste (bottom right).

I use egg cartoons (on top of the metal bin in the photo), to place under the organic bin, so that they soak any liquid leaks.

Only pure and clean paper is recycled, like newspapers and such. They are inside the leftmost cabinet (not in the picture). Pamuk likes to go inside of it.
