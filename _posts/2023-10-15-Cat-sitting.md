Here is quick info for how to take care of Pamuk and Kucuk:


### Pamuk
![Pamuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/pamuk.webp)

Male. Aware of everything. Only likes to be petted by me. Likes eating, going out.

### Küçük
![Kucuk](/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/kucuk.webp "Küçük")

Female, shy, never gets aggressive. Likes dry food, affection, getting brushed.

## Dangers
 
### Blankets

Küçük sleeps under blankets. Sitting or laying on them without checking can be fatal.

### Stove

They jump on it and may accidentally turn it on or burn their paws.

Place the pan handle so that it block the turn on switch:

### Being Locked Outside

Don't close the windows when they're outside.

If you're leaving home, if they're outside, make sure to leave the window open as informed in [Letting Out](#letting-out) section.


If they're home, close the windows.

## Letting Out

If you let them out, they'll show up after some time by the window. Keep the kitchen window open, they will come back.

Place the half ball on the corner:

Adjust the lever, to make sure window won't be closed by a drift:

To stop  cold, you may push the kitchen door, so they can push it open when they come back.

You may let them out before going to sleep.

## Feeding

- Take one pouch from this box in the morning and evening:

For wet food, You may use flat plate instead of their bowl, to avoid cleaning.

Pamuk may spill some food, a piece of napkins under the plate can help.


Pamuk eats more wet food, Kucuk rarely eats, therefore I give ~70% of the pouch to Pamuk, and ~30% to Kucuk:

To compensate, I give Kucuk more dry food:

{%- include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/cat-sitting/dry_food_distribution.jpg" description="Dry food distribution. Pamuk eats ~10%, Kucuk ~90%" -%}



Pamuk eats Kucuk's food. To prevent this you need to separate them:

- Put Pamuk's food under kitchen table first.
- While he is eating, put Kucuk's food in bedroom, under the chair.
- Close the door and leave her alone. You may instead close the kitchen door, leaving Pamuk inside the kitchen.  
- Pamuk will wait at her door, demanding opening the door. Allow Kucuk to at least 5 minutes in piece, after which you may open the door.
- Now you can give them dry food, again in separate rooms.

[//]: # (Share one box between two cats for morning, one for evening. So you'll consume two boxes per day.)

**Don't forget to rinse and change their water once a day**

## Pamuk's medicine

Pamuk has to take his pill on Saturday and Monday. I crushed the pills and made dust, and put them in little glasses, in the picture below. All you have to do is pour one glass on his wet food. I've prepared 3 glasses, one is for safety.

## Litter Box
- There should not be much litter in the box, it should be around 3 centimeters deep
- There is a bottom tray and meshed container on top, which lets the pee to flow to bottom tray
- For couple days no cleaning is usually needed. You may take the turd from top with the shovel and stir the litter a bit
- To clean, take the whole thing to bathroom, take away the top part and shovel off the stuff in the bottom tray to toilet bowl
- You may add one or two fistful of litter after a week

Use the top buttons on the remote to turn on / off the reading light in main room.
